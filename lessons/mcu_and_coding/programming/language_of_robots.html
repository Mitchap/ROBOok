              Imagine trying to teach a dog a new trick. You can't just speak to it in English; you need to use specific commands and actions it understands. Similarly, robots don't understand human languages. Instead, we use special languages called 'programming languages' to give them instructions. In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concept of programming and how we use these languages to communicate with robots.

              </h4>
              <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
                <p>Imagine you want to bake a cake üéÇ. You can't just throw ingredients together and hope for the best, right? You need a recipe! This recipe is a set of step-by-step instructions that tells you exactly what to do: mix flour, add sugar, bake at a certain temperature, etc.
                </p>
                
                <p>Programming is kind of like writing a recipe, but instead of telling a baker what to do, you're creating a set of instructions that a computer (or a robot!) can follow. The recipe is the "program," and the computer or robot is the "baker."
                </p>
                
                <p>So, in simple terms, programming is how we tell computers (and robots) what to do!</p>

              <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
                <p>Computers and robots don't understand English or Tagalog the way we do. They need a special way of being told what to do, and that's where programming languages come in.</p>
                                
                <p>A programming language is a formal language with its own specific rules and syntax (like grammar in a human language). It's like a secret code we use to write computer programs. Different programming languages are designed for different purposes, just like there are different kinds of recipes for different kinds of food.</p>
                                
                <p>There are tons of different programming languages out there! You might have heard of some like Python, Java, or C++. In this course, we're going to focus on the Arduino programming language, which is great for controlling electronics and robots.</p>

              <p>Why do robots need programming? Well, they're not born knowing what to do! Robots need instructions to perform tasks. Programming is the key to giving them those instructions.</p>
              
            <ul class="d-grid gap-3">
              <p>With programming, we can:</p>
              <li>Control a robot's behavior: Make it move forward, turn, grab things, or even dance!</li>
              <li>Enable decision-making: Program robots to react to their surroundings based on information from sensors.
              </li>
              <li>Make them interact with their environment: Allow them to respond to light, sound, touch, and other inputs.</li>
              <li>Achieve specific goals: Program robots to complete tasks, whether it's navigating a maze or assembling a product.
              </li>

            </ul>

              </h4>
              <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
              <p>The basic process of writing a program goes something like this:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Break it down: First, you need to figure out the task you want the computer or robot to do and break it down into smaller, logical steps.
                </li>
                <li>Write the steps: Then, you write those steps down using the specific rules of a programming language.</li>
                <li>Execute: The computer or robot reads these instructions one by one, in order, and performs them.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Let's take a super simple example: making an LED turn on. We can think of the steps like this:</p>

              </div>
              <div class="p-2 my-5" style="background-color: #1b1b1b; color: rgb(154, 228, 43);">
                <pre>

  START
      Turn the LED ON
  END</pre>
              </div>
              <p>In a programming language (like Arduino), this might look something like this (we'll learn this later!):</p>
              <div class="p-1" style="background-color: #1b1b1b; ">
<pre style="color: rgb(232, 83, 207);">

            </h4>
            <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
            <p>Just like there are different ways to communicate with people (talking, writing, sign language), there are different types of programming languages. Two main types you'll encounter are:</p>
            <ul class="d-grid gap-3">
              <li>Text-based languages: These are like writing instructions using words, symbols, and specific grammar. Arduino, C++, and Python are examples of text-based languages. You type out lines of code.
              </li>
              <li>Block-based languages: These are more visual. Instead of typing lines of code, you drag and drop colorful blocks that represent different commands and connect them like puzzle pieces. Scratch (which you might have seen before) and the block-based coding in Tinkercad are examples of this.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this course, we're going to start with block-based coding in Tinkercad because it's a really fun and easy way to learn the basics of programming. Once you're comfortable with the concepts, we'll move on to text-based coding with Arduino, which gives you even more control over your robots and projects!

  {
    question: "What is programming most similar to, according to the lesson?",
    a: "Playing a game",
    b: "Following a recipe",
    c: "Watching a robot show",
    d: "Drawing on a computer screen",
    correct: "b",
    explanation: "Programming is like writing a recipe ‚Äî step-by-step instructions for a computer.",
    wrongExplanations: {
      a: "Incorrect. While programming can feel playful, it‚Äôs not the best analogy here.",
      c: "Incorrect. Watching robots isn't the same as controlling them.",
      d: "Incorrect. Drawing is creative but doesn‚Äôt involve logic-based instructions."
    },
  },
  {
    question: "Why do we use programming languages?",
    a: "To decorate programs",
    b: "To talk to robots and computers",
    c: "To make the screen colorful",
    d: "To organize your computer desktop",
    correct: "b",
    explanation: "Programming languages help us communicate with machines in a way they understand.",
    wrongExplanations: {
      a: "Incorrect. Programming isn‚Äôt about decorating ‚Äî it‚Äôs about communication.",
      c: "Incorrect. You can do cool things with code, but that‚Äôs not its main purpose.",
      d: "Incorrect. That‚Äôs more of a desktop feature than a coding concept."
    },
  },
  {
    question: "What type of programming will we start with in this course?",
    a: "Text-based coding in Arduino",
    b: "Scratch-based mobile apps",
    c: "Block-based coding in Tinkercad",
    d: "Drawing-based coding with Java",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "We'll begin with block-based coding in Tinkercad, which is beginner-friendly.",
    wrongExplanations: {
      a: "Incorrect. We‚Äôll do that later, but not as a starting point.",
      b: "Incorrect. Scratch is similar, but we‚Äôre using Tinkercad for block coding.",
      d: "Incorrect. Java isn‚Äôt part of this course ‚Äî and coding isn‚Äôt based on drawing."
    },
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is an example of a text-based programming language?",
    a: "Scratch",
    b: "Blockly",
    c: "Python",
    d: "Tinkercad Blocks",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "Python is a powerful text-based programming language.",
    wrongExplanations: {
      a: "Incorrect. Scratch is block-based, not text-based.",
      b: "Incorrect. Blockly is another block-based system.",
      d: "Incorrect. Tinkercad uses blocks to represent code visually."
    },
  },
  {
    question: "Why do robots need programming?",
    a: "To charge their batteries",
    b: "To watch videos online",
    c: "To follow instructions and perform tasks",
    d: "To take photos of their surroundings",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "Robots need programming to follow instructions and do useful things.",
    wrongExplanations: {
      a: "Incorrect. Charging is about hardware, not programming.",
      b: "Incorrect. That‚Äôs not their primary function ‚Äî and wouldn‚Äôt need programming.",
      d: "Incorrect. Robots might take photos, but only if they‚Äôre programmed to do so."
    },
