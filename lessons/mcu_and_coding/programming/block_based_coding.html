              Ready to start speaking robot? One of the easiest ways to begin programming is with block-based coding. Imagine snapping together colorful LEGO blocks, but instead of building a tower, you're building a set of instructions for a virtual robot! Tinkercad provides a fantastic way to learn this, and in this lesson, we'll take our first steps into the world of programming using Tinkercad's visual block interface.

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Control:</strong> Blocks that manage the flow of your program (like waiting, repeating, or making decisions).</li>

              <h4 class="mt-5">Common Programming Blocks üí™</h4>
              <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
                <p>Let's check out some of the blocks you'll use a lot:</p>
            
                <p><strong>wait (1) seconds:</strong> This block tells the program to pause for the specified amount of time (in seconds). Think of it as the robot taking a little break before doing the next thing.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> wait (0.5) seconds makes the program pause for half a second.</p>
            
                <p><strong>set pin (13) to HIGH / set pin (13) to LOW:</strong> This block controls the digital output pins of the Arduino. HIGH usually means turning something ON (like sending power), and LOW means turning it OFF (stopping the power). The number in the block specifies which pin to control.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> set pin (8) to HIGH turns on whatever is connected to digital pin 8.</p>
            
                <p><strong>read digital pin (2):</strong> This block reads the state (HIGH or LOW) of a specific digital input pin. It's like asking if a button connected to that pin is pressed (HIGH) or not (LOW).</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> If a button is connected to digital pin 2, this block will tell you if it's currently being pressed.</p>
            
                <p><strong>read analog pin (A0):</strong> This block reads the voltage value from a specific analog input pin. Analog pins can read a range of values, like the brightness from a light sensor. The value you get will be a number representing that voltage.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> If a light sensor is connected to analog pin A0, this block will give you a number that tells you how bright it is.</p>
            
                <p><strong>repeat (10) times:</strong> This block is a loop. It tells the program to execute the blocks placed inside it a specific number of times. It's great for making things happen repeatedly.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> Putting set pin (13) to HIGH inside a repeat (3) times block will turn pin 13 ON three times in a row (very quickly!).</p>
            
                <p><strong>if (condition) do:</strong> This is a conditional statement. The blocks inside this block will only be executed if the condition you specify is true. It allows your program to make decisions.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> if (read digital pin (7) == HIGH) do { set pin (12) to HIGH } means "IF the button on digital pin 7 is pressed (HIGH), THEN turn ON the LED connected to digital pin 12."</p>

              <div class="d-grid gap-2 mt-4">
                <p>Block-based coding is a fantastic way to grasp fundamental programming ideas without getting bogged down in typing rules:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> The order you snap the blocks together is crucial! The Arduino will execute the instructions in that exact order, one after the other, from top to bottom. It's like following the steps in a recipe.</li>
                  <li><strong>Loops:</strong> The repeat block shows you how to make the Arduino do the same set of instructions over and over again. This is super useful for things like blinking an LED continuously or making a robot move in a circle.</li>
                  <li><strong>Conditional statements:</strong> The if...do block introduces the idea of decision-making. Your program can check if something is true or false and then do different things based on the result. This is how robots can react to their environment.</li>

Connect the other side of the button to 5V (through a pull-up or pull-down resistor for proper behavior, but Tinkercad often handles this simply). Also, make sure you have an LED connected to a digital output pin (e.g., pin 12) with a resistor.

              <p>
                Block-based programming is like building with digital LEGO bricks üß±üí°‚Äîeach block is a command that tells the robot what to do. Instead of writing code, you drag and snap these visual blocks together to create programs. It‚Äôs fun, easy, and a perfect way to start your coding journey!
              </p>        
              <ul class="d-grid gap-3">
                <li>üß© Block-based coding uses colorful visual blocks that represent real programming commands.</li>
                <li>üß† Tinkercad makes it simple to program circuits using blocks with drag-and-drop tools.</li>
                <li>üõ†Ô∏è You explored important block categories: Control, Input, Output, and Math.</li>
                <li>üîÅ You learned how to build basic programs using blocks like wait, set pin, read pin, repeat, and if...do.</li>
                <li>ü§ñ These blocks help robots follow sequences, repeat actions, and make decisions based on inputs‚Äîlike pressing a button to turn on an LED.</li>
              </ul>
